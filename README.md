# 🧪 Hepatitis C diagnosis using machine learning

This repository contains my Master's Thesis (TFM) in Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, focused on building and comparing machine learning models to predict hepatitis C based on clinical and biochemical data.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop and evaluate predictive models for hepatitis C diagnosis using supervised machine learning techniques, including data exploration, hypothesis testing, feature correlations, and model performance analysis.
